sklearn_tools
=============

Some tools I commonly use for data science with python's pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy libraries. The general idea is to make Python's interface more verbose when running statistical tests. One of the benefits of R is that it is a full statistical package -- this repo aims to fill that gap by providing a more complete and verbose environment for statistical analysis.
